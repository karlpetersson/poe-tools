## Preparation

## GMGP
List methods for $

### Wierd stuff with recipes
Buy cheap ilvl84 auxium, vaal into rares and sell 5 -> 1
Buy cheap items with only 2 affix -> sell for scour?
Lvl 20 gem + 1 gcp -> 20% quality lvl 1 gem
Primordial might + harmony + eminence = anima stone (can pricefix these)
Feastbind(40c) + Faminebind(40c) + fuse = The Retch(100c)
Ruby ring (any rarity) + unique gold amu + crim. jew with silence immune -> star of wraeclast


### Snipe filters
```
items
expensive currency (mirror etc)
valuable uniques that can be found anywhere
	armors
	weapons
	jewels
	flasks
div cards
	which can be found early/anywhere?
	should list most cards
6-linked armors
	especially vaal regalia (or maybe ES too nerfed?)
	Bows (for +2 gems and so on)
Valuable corruptions
	endurance charge belts
	+ curses amus
ilvl 84 stuff
	opal rings (even below 84)
	steel rings (even below 84)
	fingerless gloves
	crystal belt (even below 84)
	even craft bases early on?
Levling items for build
	Tabula rasa
	etc
Insane jewels
	can be found early, hard to price
Empower
Enlighten
Rares
	Focus on a lot of rares with specific stats that can be underpriced.
```

### Vaal
Viridian jewels(? check which base) for CoC
Any for example cheap neck/belt for +1

### Crafting
* Chaos spam should be really viable early on, maybe focus on vaal regalias? Or other bases depending on how shitty ES is after patch. 
* Maybe craft weapons? alt regal for good damage and then multi-mod 
* Jewels: follow the guide. In short, alt+regal and throw in 3/5/8/10 etc c tabs
* delirium wands/bows?
* Need to read up on guideszzzz

#### From the russian guy
* Look up guides to find items to craft.
* Shipyard drops crystal belts, craftable
* Buy an opal ring ilvl 81 plus before they get expensive and use wrath essence to craft a sellable one NOT IMPORTANT that its an opal ring. Its the basic idea that crafting materials are cheaper than the items, since noone crafts.
* Steel rings, crystal belts, so on, good for essence crafting
* When you feel the odds are in your favor, go ahead and start crafting
* 6L Item early in league is terrible gamble, way too low chance of success
* Better to craft something safe and build currency. But what is safe??????
* opal/steel/unset rings only essences, for ele or chaos damage or minion move speed (?)
* http://poedb.tw/us/mod.php
* dagger essence of torment for spell lightning damage

### Stuff to buy and hold
Mirrors (several)

### Actually playing
Reach high content fast. Sell maps, shaper sets, crafting bases etc
Get high level masters fast to multi-mod, ES% etc

## Playthrough
Step by step playthrough + important things to pick up at certain stages at the game.

### basic idea
* Run through the game, snipe stuff as they come up. Start mapping, get to high content fast.
* Save blue jewels and other stuff for crafting
* Start crafting when we have sufficient currency and access to crafting bases
* Buy mirrors as they show up if you can afford. They will rise in price.
